# Basics Check

Create two integer variables with the values `15` and `30`.

Use `if` statements and the variables above to decide whether or not to print the following sentences:
- If 15 is less than 30, print `"15 is less than 30"`
- If 15 * 2 is equal to 30, print `"15 * 2 is equal to 30"`

Please note that the only time you should be writing the numbers 15 and 30 is when you are creating the variables. The `if` statements and `print` statements should all use the variables, not the values themselves.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
