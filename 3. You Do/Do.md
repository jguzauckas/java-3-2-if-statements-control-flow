# You Do

In role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons, users will frequently roll a 20-sided dice to determine if they can or cannot do something.

Program a whole number variable called `dice` that will use random numbers to randomly get a whole number from 1 to 20.

Program another whole number variable called `requirement` that you assign the number `12` to.

Use a print statements to print out the sentence `"You rolled a #!"`.

Use `if` statements to potentially print out the following sentences:
- When the dice number is at least the requirement number, print `"You passed the check!"`
- When the dice number is lower than the requirement number, print `"You failed the check!"`

Here are a couple of sample outputs the program could produce (your results may vary due to the random number):

```
You rolled a 7!
You failed the check!
```

```
You rolled a 18!
You passed the check!
```

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
