# AP Computer Science A - Unit 3 Section 2

# `if` Statements and Control Flow

This section introduces one of our most versatile tools to date: the `if` statement, which will allow to selectively run lines of code as needed.

Due to the nature of Java, certain elements of a Java program are going to be taken for granted and ultimately ignored as we work with the basics, but are required for the program to run successfully. I encourage you to read them and start to internalize them as they'll become a key aspect of the work we do as the year goes on.

This section covers the following material:

- Control Flow
- `if` Statements

To use this repository, start with the `notes.md` document, referencing the various `.java` documents as you go to see the examples in action.

Once you have completed the assignment, save the Java files and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
